# UUID
UUID is a library that implements UUIDs in Go. It supports writing and reading
from SQL databases. If you require a more fully featured library, I would
reccomend [Google's UUID Library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/uuid).
However I have found this smaller library to be more than sufficent thus far.

## Documentation
Documentation can be found at
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/uuid).

## Testing
This library can be tested with
``` bash
go test
```
